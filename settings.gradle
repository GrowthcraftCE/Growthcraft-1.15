/* Pre-Loader for build.gradle

Gradle Docs - Always define a settings file

Gradle tries to locate a settings.gradle (Groovy DSL) or a settings.gradle.kts (Kotlin DSL) file with every
invocation of the build. For that purpose, the runtime walks the hierarchy of the directory tree up to the
root directory. The algorithm stops searching as soon as it finds the settings file.

Always add a settings.gradle to the root directory of your build to avoid the initial performance impact.
This recommendation applies to single project builds as well as multi-project builds. The file can either
be empty or define the desired name of the project.
